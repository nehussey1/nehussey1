# Emergent symmetry in LMO
---

Resistivity vs. temperature; Magnetoresistance (fractional change in resistivity) vs. magnetic field strength; Hall coefficient vs. temperature and Lorenz ratio vs. temperature data for different lithium molybdate (LMO) single crystals for current and magnetic field oriented along different directions, as specified in the main manuscript.

## Description of the data and file structure

All files are labelled according to the corresponding Figure (and panel) in the main manuscript or Supplementary Material in which the data appear. 

Any files with 'rho' in the title consist of resistivity vs. temperature data, the subscript after the 'rho' label referring to the current direction. 

Any files with 'rho_0' in the title consist of the zero-field resistivity vs. temperature data for the field sweeps from with the magnetoresistance (MR) data were obtained.

For Figures S1 and S3, the files contain MR (fractional change in resistivity) vs. field. The numbers in the filenames refer to the temperature at which the particular field sweep was executed.

For Figures S2, S4, S5, S6 and S7, the files are split into field columns (labelled with a 'H') and MR columns (labelled with a 'MR'). Again, the numbers in the filenames refer to the temperature at which the particular field sweep was executed.

Any files with 'Inv_sqrt_MR' in the title contain the inverse square root of the coefficient of the H^2 fits to the low-field data associated with each field sweep.

Any files with 'RH' in the title consist of Hall coefficient vs. temperature data. 

Any files with 'Lorenz ratio' in the title consist of Lorenz ratio vs. temperature data.

Samples 1 (SC sample with 𝑇𝑐 = 2.15 K), 2 (SC sample with 𝑇𝑐 = 2.2 K) and 3 (Non-SC sample) refer to samples I, II and III in the main manuscript.
